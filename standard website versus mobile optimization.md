### Out with the old: ~~standard website~~ - And, in with the new: **Mobile Optimized Website** 

1. Standard Website vs. Mobile Optimized Website
  * With the majority of page views coming from mobile devices, it almost seems unresponsible to create just a standard website.
  * Creating a responsive website which will display information differently on different devices using media queries seems like the new standard operating procedure.

2. Mobile first designs (i.e. designing website for mobile device visits prior to desktop/laptop access)
  * Focusing on mobile first designs is the most cost effective way to approach this sort of development.
  * And, should there be anything else needed for laptop/desktop users, one-off enhancements can be made thereafter to accomodate larger displays.

3. Front-End Frameworks that Assist with Creating Responsive Web Applications
  * Twitter Bootstrap [Download here!](http://getbootstrap.com/)
  * Zurb Foundation [Download here!](http://getbootstrap.com/)

4. Mobile Application
  * At some point, users may prefer a native mobile application rather than accessing the site over the web.
  * There are some services out there that allow the conversion of a mobile site to a mobile application, however they do not provide a customized feel for specific devices.
    * Phonegap / Cordova [Download here!](http://phonegap.com/)
  * Other services allow for a bit more customization using Javascript of C# to cater to different devices, but there are still limitations in its performance.
    * Titanium Appcelerator [Download here!](http://www.appcelerator.com/)
  * The best performance, however, comes when you invest more money to build a native application to a specific device.
    * Developing native mobile applications is difficult because you must develop different products in different languages that cater to different devices. There is not a one-size-fits-all here.
    * iOS would have to be coded in either objective-c or swift, and android applications would have to be coded in Java.
