**Front-end languages**:        
**HTML**: HyperText Markup Language. Which adds some tags to your text to denote things like whether they are a heading, an image or a link.

**CSS**: Cascading StyleSheet. File to make the HTML look prettier, and sometimes include some content changes

**Javascript**: Javascript. Which adds behavior to the page -‐‐ whether it's making text slide up a page, implementing tabs or validating that your email address or phone number is well formatted before submitting a form. 

**Back-end technologies**:     
**Java**: Java is one of the most popular programming languages in use, particularly for client-server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers.

**C#**: A multi-paradigm programming language encompassing strong typing, imperative, declarative, functional, generic, object-oriented (class-based), and component-oriented programming disciplines.

**Ruby**: Dynamic, object oriented programming. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including functional, object-oriented, and imperative. It also has a dynamic type system and automatic memory management.

**Python**: Widely used general-purpose, high-level programming language.Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than would be possible in languages such as C++ or Java.

**PHP**: PHP is a server-side scripting language designed for web development but also used as a general-purpose programming language. 

**Perl**: Perl is a family of high-level, general-purpose, interpreted, dynamic programming languages. The languages in this family include Perl 5 and Perl 6.The Perl languages borrow features from other programming languages including C, shell script (sh), AWK, and sed. They provide powerful text processing facilities without the arbitrary data-length limits of many contemporary Unix commandline tools, facilitating easy manipulation of text files.

**Frameworks**:
**Angular**: an open-source web application framework maintained by Google and by a community of individual developers and corporations to address many of the challenges encountered in developing single-page applications.

**iQuery**:which makes it easier to write the code for common front end tasks in Javascript.

**Ember**: is an open-source JavaScript application framework, based on the model-view-controller (MVC) pattern. It allows developers to create scalable single-page web applications[1] by incorporating common idioms and best practices into the framework.
