### Out with the old: standard website - And, in with the new: **Mobile Optimized Website** 

:one: Standard Website vs. Mobile Optimized Website 
  * With the majority of page views coming from mobile devices, it almost seems unresponsible to create just a standard website.
  * Creating a responsive website which will display information differently on different devices using media queries seems like the new standard operating procedure.

:two: Mobile first designs (i.e. designing website for mobile device visits prior to desktop/laptop access)
  * Focusing on mobile first designs is the most cost effective way to approach this sort of development.
  * And, should there be anything else needed for laptop/desktop users, one-off enhancements can be made thereafter to accomodate larger displays.

:three: Front-End Frameworks that Assist with Creating Responsive Web Applications
  * Twitter Bootstrap [Download here!](http://getbootstrap.com/)
  * Zurb Foundation [Download here!](http://getbootstrap.com/)

:four: Mobile Application
  * At some point, users may prefer a native mobile application rather than accessing the site over the web.
  * There are some services out there that allow the conversion of a mobile site to a mobile application, however they do not provide a customized feel for specific devices.
    * Phonegap / Cordova [Download here!](http://phonegap.com/)
  * Other services allow for a bit more customization using Javascript of C# to cater to different devices, but there are still limitations in its performance.
    * Titanium Appcelerator [Download here!](http://www.appcelerator.com/)
  * The best performance, however, comes when you invest more money to build a native application to a specific device.
    * Developing native mobile applications is difficult because you must develop different products in different languages that cater to different devices. There is not a one-size-fits-all here.
    * iOS would have to be coded in either objective-c or swift, and android applications would have to be coded in Java.
